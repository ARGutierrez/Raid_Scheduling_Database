Final Project for Database Fundamentals.

The goal was to design a database from the ground up, including UML diagrams, a relational database scheme, and scripts for creating the tables and inserting relevant information. There is also a Java application that interfaces with the database and allows the user to insert, delete, and execute predetermined queries (found in "a10-raid-guild-queries.sql"). All actions commited are "safe" and uphold the referntial integrity constraint.
